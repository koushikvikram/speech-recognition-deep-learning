# Developing a Speech Recognition Model Using Convolutional Neural Networks

🚦⚠️👷‍♂️🏗️ Repo Under Construction 🚦⚠️👷‍♂️🏗️

> This repository is based on the liveProject [Recognize Speech Commands with Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/liveproject/recognize-speech-commands-with-deep-learning) by [Manning Publications](https://liveproject.manning.com/), for which I served as the Implementer.
